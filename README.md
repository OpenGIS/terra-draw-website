# Terra Draw Website

The official [Terra Draw](https://www.github.com/JamesLMilner/terra-draw) website repository, live at [terradraw.io](https://terradraw.io). A static Preact + Vite site that doubles as an interactive demo of the library.

## Automatic light and dark

The UI and map basemap follow the browser/OS light/dark preference automatically, with no toggle.

|          | Light | Dark |
| -------- | ----- | ---- |
| **Home** | ![Home screen in light mode: the map demo with the default Info tab and no features drawn](tests/e2e/documentation/screenshots/home-light.png) | ![Home screen in dark mode: the same default map demo on the dark basemap](tests/e2e/documentation/screenshots/home-dark.png) |
| **Demo** | ![Demo in light mode: a route line loaded from GeoJSON spanning Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, listed in the Info panel](tests/e2e/documentation/screenshots/demo-light.png) | ![Demo in dark mode: the same route line on the dark basemap](tests/e2e/documentation/screenshots/demo-dark.png) |

*The demo row shows the app loaded with a real multi-day route: one GeoJSON LineString spanning Atlantic Canada, listed in the Info panel.*

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 (CI pins `24.18.0`)
- npm 11

## Installation

```bash
npm ci
```

## Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) over HTTP. Browsers treat `localhost` as a secure context, so the geolocation button works locally.

## Testing

For tests, install the Playwright browser first:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

See [`documentation/5.testing.md`](documentation/5.testing.md) for the full testing guide.
